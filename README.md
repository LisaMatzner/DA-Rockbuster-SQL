# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project (SQL)
The Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis is a portfolio project created in 2022. 

For this project, all of Rockbuster's data was loaded into a relational database management system and analyzed using SQL. The compiled results of the analysis were presented to the management board.

## Context
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The business intelligence (BI) department needs help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. To do that, the department needed to have the answers to a series of ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

In addition to the results of the key business questions, the final deliverables include a data dictionary.

## Key Questions
Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
